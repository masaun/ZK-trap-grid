# Sample test data for the simplified position-movement circuit
# The circuit verifies that:
# 1. Move coordinates are within grid bounds (0-7 for 8x8 grid)
# 2. trap_value is boolean (0 or 1)
# 3. trap_value matches is_hit (claimed result)

[public_inputs]
# Move coordinates (x, y) - must be in range [0, 7] for 8x8 grid
move_x = "2"
move_y = "3"

# Claimed result: 1 for hit, 0 for miss
is_hit = "1"

[private_inputs]
# Actual trap value at (move_x, move_y): 0 for no trap, 1 for trap
# Must match is_hit for the proof to verify
trap_value = "1"
